-INSTALLATION-

1.) Download either the raw source AHK script itself, the compiled AHK .exe binary, or the 7zip package that includes both.<br />
2.) Create a folder that you wish to be the home of the Overseer, its recommended you put it in its own folder.<br />
3.) If you downloaded just the raw source AHK script itself, then install [Autohotkey v1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe).
